to upload from cmd line while IN the directory holding your file:

"git status"
then
"git add" + file name
then
"git status"
then
"git comit -m 'place description of your file' "
then
"git remote"   --> should return "origin"
then
"git push origin master" --> here's my confusion...not sure if it really is master.  

I have figured out how to use the desktop.  Let me know if you want to speak for me to step you through.
